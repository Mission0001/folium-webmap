# folium-webmap

This is my project in GE 124 - FUNDAMENTALS OF GEO-INFORMATICS were I create a simple web map using folium which is a powerful Python library that helps to create several types of Leaflet maps. .

Create or enhance your web map so that it can be used to solve real-world problems.
Your Web Map must meet all these requirements:

1. Must have markers and shapefiles, and each of them has information every time you click or hover it with the mouse.
2. Save it as a HTML File.
3. Use the iframe HTML tag to embed your web map into another HTML file.
4. Put some information about your created web map in the HTML file.
